Source code for scrapers which I modified accordingly:
https://github.com/vnherdeiro/transfermarkt-scraping (my modificiations contained in a folder transfermarkt-scraping-master modified)
https://github.com/parth1902/Scrape-FBref-data (my modifications contained in a file FBRef_scrap_modified.ipynb)
+ including my own scraper for players values on Transfermarkt.

Folder "data" contains scraped and merged data for 2017/18-2020/21 seasons.

Folder "teams" contains .txt files necessary for my own scraper.

Licencjat.ipynb is a file which I used for my own calculations.

Repository is going to be updated and described better in a future as I finish my final thesis.
